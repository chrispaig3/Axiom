# Ambient-effect distribution: the measurement behind "only IO is required".
#
# WHAT STANDS. `docs/reference.md` Effects: silence claims "performs no
# IO" (`AX3042`), and a refuted claim is `AX3010`. `Alloc` and `Mut` are
# ambient - inferred and reported but never demanded - and the line was
# measured rather than chosen: requiring `Mut` would tag nearly every
# effectful function, distinguishing nothing from nothing.
#
# WHAT THIS PINS. The full distribution of inferred effect rows, in two
# views, because the claim "ambient" is a claim about a population:
#
#   compiler  `symbols --calls self_host/main.ax`: the compiler and the
#             stdlib it reaches. 4,541 functions; 2,857 perform, 2,171
#             of those exactly `Alloc,Mut`; `Mut` anywhere in 2,679 of
#             the 2,857 (94%).
#   stdlib    one probe importing every stdlib module: the whole
#             library's. 824 functions; 414 perform, 180 of those
#             exactly `Alloc,Mut`; customs are two singletons (`Assert`,
#             `Fallible`); 3 rows carry `#effects-incomplete`.
#
# RE-PINNED 2026-09-17, and the conversation recorded rather than
# waved through: the August pins (4,330 functions) stood through the
# macro and region work that added 211 more, and every IO bucket is
# frozen to the digit - 39/19/4 here, customs and companions
# untouched in the stdlib view - so nothing new performs IO and
# nothing gained or lost it. The growth sits in `pure` (+94) and in
# ambient-only buckets, and `Mut`-anywhere reads 93.8%, still 94%:
# requiring `Mut` would still tag nearly every effectful function,
# distinguishing nothing from nothing. The line holds; the numbers
# move with the tree.
#
# RE-PINNED 2026-09-18: `restrict(no-untrapped)` and the test-runner
# hooks add ten functions and move nothing else. Diffed old against
# new `symbols --calls` row by row over `self_host/main.ax`: added
# 10, removed 0, changed 0. The eight effectful ones
# (`restrictNoUntrapped`, `restrictEmitUntrappeds`,
# `emitRestrictUntrapped`, `untrappedScanInto/In/Vec/Cond/Arms`) read
# exactly `Alloc,Mut`, and the two predicates (`isUntrappedOp`,
# `testHookKind`) are pure - so exactly-`Alloc,Mut` moves 2177 to
# 2185 and `pure` 1687 to 1689, every IO bucket frozen again, and
# `Mut`-anywhere still rounds to 94%. The required/ambient line did
# not move; the pins did, by the delta above and no more.
#
# RE-PINNED 2026-09-20: `cond`/`cond2`/`cond3` are removed (AX2004)
# and the variadic `if` takes their place, deleting the cond
# machinery from every pass. Diffed trunk-today against the branch
# `symbols --calls` row by row over `self_host/main.ax`, each side
# measured by a compiler built from its own tree: added 1
# (`parseIfTail`, exactly `Alloc,Mut`), removed 37, changed 0. The
# removed read 32 exactly-`Alloc,Mut` (the cond walkers, checkers
# and lowerers: `checkCond`, `lowerConds`, `fpCond`, `parseCondExpr`
# and their clause helpers), one exactly-`Alloc` (`condBodyOf`), and
# four pure (`clausesNamePrim`, `kwCond`, `kwElse`,
# `tplClausesHaveRepeat`) - so exactly-`Alloc,Mut` moves 2197 to
# 2166, exactly-`Alloc` 120 to 119, and `pure` 1693 to 1689, which
# is the old pin again by arithmetic, not by standing still. The
# `Alloc,IO,Mut` pin moves 381 to 396 with NONE of it from this
# diff: trunk-today already measures 396 (drift since the September
# 18 pin, from other work), the branch measures 396 too, and the
# row diff moves no function into or out of any IO bucket - every
# IO bucket is frozen by this change. `Mut`-anywhere reads 93.8%,
# still 94%. The required/ambient line did not move; the pins did,
# by the delta above and no more.
#
# RE-PINNED 2026-09-21: one AXTAG check reads once per claim instead
# of once per tagged declaration. Diffed c56e6756 against the working
# tree `symbols --calls` row by row over `self_host/main.ax`, each side
# measured by a compiler built from its own tree: added 2, removed 0.
# The added are the union-then-check-once helpers themselves -
# `axtagContentSeen`, pure, and `checkAxtagsFromSkipping`, exactly
# `Alloc,Mut` - and the two non-positional changes move no bucket
# (`checkAxtags` calls the skipping walk now, same row;
# `fmtOnce` gains its completion bound as a parameter, same row).
# So exactly-`Alloc,Mut` moves 2166 to 2167 and `pure` 1689 to 1690,
# every IO bucket frozen again. The required/ambient line did not
# move; the pins did, by the delta above and no more.
#
# RE-PINNED 2026-09-21 (2): the `__store64`-of-reference refusal adds
# five functions and moves nothing else. `checkStoreWordRefusal`,
# `storeOperandTy`, `storeVarTy`, `storeCastOperand` and
# `emitStoreWordUnretained` all read exactly `Alloc,Mut` (vectors and
# diagnostics) - five new functions, one bucket up by five, every
# other bucket frozen, which is what the gate itself reports. The
# required/ambient line did not move; the pin did, by that delta.
#
# RE-PINNED 2026-09-21 (3): the `__addr`-of-nonliteral refusal adds
# one function, `checkAddrLitRefusal`, reading exactly `Alloc,Mut`
# (its diagnostic), and moves nothing else - so exactly-`Alloc,Mut`
# moves 2172 to 2173, every other bucket frozen. The
# required/ambient line did not move.
#
# Every bucket is pinned exactly. A refactor that moves functions
# between buckets fails here, and the failure is a conversation about
# whether the required/ambient line still sits where it was measured -
# which is what makes this a measurement rather than a comment. The
# negative probes refuse doctored counts, so a comparison that accepts
# everything cannot hide here.
